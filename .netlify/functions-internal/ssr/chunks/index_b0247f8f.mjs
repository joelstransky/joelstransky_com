A theme built in scope of re-use is a very different thing than one built for a one-off site. A huge part of the value to the client and thus a huge part of the work was abstracting all of the tooling so that all assets are configurable, the database is protected and child themes are able to leverage api defined in the parent to create new features.\r\n\r\nThe entire UH System will combine information from across their island campuses into a central portal using this theme for each department's home. The first site took a little over a year, the second took a month.\r\n\r\n ![Title IX and The Office of Institutional Equity](assets/www-hawaii-edu-titleix-2.png)\r\n ![Title IX and The Office of Institutional Equity](assets/www-hawaii-edu-titleix-help-coordinator-2.png) \r\n";
