At Superb.net I wore both developer and project manager hats. I worked on updating aging pages, promotional campaigns, some design work and their live chat.
I also completely rebuilt their corporate facing site, hopone.net.

Oh! and if you want to hear my voice, I did all the voice over for this series of walkthroughs. I was handed silent screen recordings and a script so I had to record and clean up the audio, splice it into the video and do lots of time stretching to line things up. I of course built the page too.
