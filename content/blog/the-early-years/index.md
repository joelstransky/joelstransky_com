My career started just out of high-school and I'm proud to say has been on a constant incline ever since. I'm exponentially more talentaned than I was back then but few experiences compare to the sense of conquest that came with making my own way in the world as a young t-shirt designer.

After being hired by my mentor, I joined a studio he started and later purchased it from him. I merged that with a fellow designer when our first web design requests started rolling in. We quickly became in demand and were later absorbed by a local advertising agency.

I'm happy to finally toss a stack of CD's I've been lugging around the world for some reason and now offer the complete works of ArtSource1 for public consumption.
