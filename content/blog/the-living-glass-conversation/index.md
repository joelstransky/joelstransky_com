Owens Illinois commissioned Joshua Davis to direct an interactive experience promoting the use of recycled glass. Joshua collaborated with long time friend Branden Hall to develop a living voronoi diagram inspired by the molecular structure of glass. Each node represents a single piece of social data discussing the good part of glass.

I was responsible for the flash content surrounding the diagram, filtering and rendering the actual content of each node.
