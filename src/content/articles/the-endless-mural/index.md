The various brush shapes used in this project were supplied by a list of artists including Joshua Davis. The brushes all started as vector images and Microsoft supplied us with an early beta of their Adobe Illustrator plugin designed to convert files into a list of commands capable of drawing the shapes in an HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; tag. I was responsible for writing a script to batch process the .ai files into a .js library.
